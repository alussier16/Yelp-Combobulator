Review aggregators like Google and Yelp can display hundreds of reviews per business. A quick glance will tell you the average stars of all these reviews, but if you want to get a comprehensive idea of that business quality, then you need to read a lot of reviews. Even then, the user is left with a fragmented judgement of the business. Our project aims to read all of the reviews of a particular business and then summarize them in one concise, comprehensive review. 

Yelp provides a similar feature called “Review Highlights” that provides snippets of highly ranked reviews that contain popular keywords. These highlights are simply sentences extracted verbatim from reviews that meet two conditions: The review contains one of the top 3 most frequent keywords, and the review has received more “useful” ratings than any other review that also contains that keyword. This highlight feature approaches the goal of providing the user with a concise review experience, but it lacks cohesion. We want to improve this feature with our Review Summary.
